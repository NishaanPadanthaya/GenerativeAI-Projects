This is a Streamlit application that generates captions for social media posts based on uploaded images. Here's a breakdown of what it does and how it works:

**Functionality:**

* This app helps users create captions for their social media posts (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook etc.).
* Users upload an image, and the app generates a creative caption based on the image content.

**How it Works:**

1. **Import Libraries:**
   - The code starts by importing libraries like streamlit, dotenv and Google's generative AI library google.generativeai
   - It also imports the Image library from Pillow for handling images.



3. **Configure Model:**
   - The genai.configure function is used to set the API key for Google's generative AI library.
   - We are using gemini-pro-vision for this application

4. **Define generate_caption function:**
   - This function takes an image as input.
   - It creates a prompt instructing the AI model to generate a social media caption based on the image content, including relevant hashtags and mentions.
   - The function utilizes Google's generative AI model's model.generate_content to process the prompt and image together.
   - Finally, it extracts the generated caption text from the model's response.

5. **Define main function:**
   - The main function creates a Streamlit application.
   - It displays a title "Social Media Caption Generator".
   - It provides a file uploader for users to select an image (supports jpg, jpeg and png formats).
   - If an image is uploaded:
      - The image is opened using Pillow's Image library.
      - The uploaded image is displayed on the app.
      - The generate_caption function is called to create a caption for the image.
      - The generated caption is displayed on the app interface.


Overall, this code demonstrates how to leverage Google's generative AI for creative text generation tasks 
like social media caption creation within a Streamlit web app framework.
