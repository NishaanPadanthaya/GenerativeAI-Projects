Objective:
The project aims to create an interactive text-based chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 model.
Users can input a text prompt or request, and the chatbot will generate a response based on the input.
Key Components:
OpenAI API Integration:

The project uses the OpenAI Python library to integrate with the GPT-3 API. The API key is set using openai.api_key.
You have to enter your Api key which you get from your openai account in the place of "yourapikey".

User Interaction:
It prompts the user to enter their request or input using the input() function. This input serves as the basis for generating a response.

Generating Responses:
The user's input is used as the prompt parameter when making a request to the GPT-3 API.
The script specifies the GPT-3 model ('text-davinci-003') to use, sets a maximum token limit for the response (max_tokens), 
and adjusts the "temperature" to control the randomness of the response.
Displaying Output:

The response from the GPT-3 API is captured, and the generated text is extracted from it.
The generated text is then printed as the output of the chatbot.

How It Works:

The user interacts with the chatbot by entering a request or prompt.
The script sends the user's input to the GPT-3 model via the OpenAI API.
The GPT-3 model generates a response based on the input, which may include text completion or elaboration.
The generated response is displayed to the user.
